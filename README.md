# TechCheck   

TechCheck is a tool that allow authors to create their on reward checks (or, better known as "bragging rights" checks) to anyone who contributed with a correction for the latest version of their books.    

This is a prototype, we do not guarantee that this will work flawlessly in production (yet).   

This respository contains the backend of the application.
